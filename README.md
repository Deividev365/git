### git init
### git remote add origin (file url from github respository)
### git add . (it referes for all the files inside your project)
### git commit -m "your message here"
### git push origin master 

# When you already have a project inside your github, you might probably need to repair and make some changes on it future. So, that's how you do it

### git status (it'll show what you've modified so far)
### git add . ('add' in this case doesn't mean 'adding' but 'save changes')
### git commit -m "your message here"
### git push (you don't have to write "origin master", bcs its already created. you're just adding some changes on the project. so, you just 'push it')
